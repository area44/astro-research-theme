  This is a live demo of a research project template built with **Astro**.  
  You can use it to create a clean, customizable page for your academic paper, project, or presentation.  

  Content is written in **MDX**, which means you can mix markdown formatting — like **bold**, *italics*, and ~strikethrough~ — with Astro components for a flexible writing experience.
