  This is a live demo of a **research project template** built with **Astro**.  
  It provides a clean, customizable framework for academic papers, project documentation, and presentations.  

  Content is written in **MDX**, so you can combine markdown formattingâ€”such as **bold**, *italics*, and <del>strikethrough</del> - with Astro components for a flexible authoring experience.

## Markdown

Use headings to structure your content into clear, readable sections.

### Heading 3

This is an example of a level-three heading.

#### Heading 4

And here is a level-four heading.

## Tables

Organize structured information using [GitHub Flavored Markdown tables](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables):

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| git status   |  git status    |     git status |
| git diff     |   git diff     |      git diff |

## LaTeX

Mathematical notation is supported via [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), rendered at build time for fast loading.  

Inline example: <LaTeX inline formula="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" />  

Block example:

<LaTeX formula="\int_a^b f(x)\, dx" />

## Video

Embed videos to showcase demos, recorded talks, or supplementary materials:  

<Video
  src="oTQizRVVDug94_su.mp4"
  name="Astro"
  description="The web is our space"
/>
