  This is a live demo of a research project template built with **Astro**.  
  You can use it to create a clean, customizable page for your academic paper, project, or presentation.  

  Content is written in **MDX**, which means you can mix markdown formatting — like **bold**, *italics*, and ~strikethrough~ — with Astro components for a flexible writing experience.

## Heading levels

Use headings to divide your content into sections.

### Heading 3

Go down a level to heading 3...

#### Heading 4

...and down again to heading 4.

## LaTeX

You can also add LaTeX formulas, rendered during the build process using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) so they're quick to load for visitors of your project page. You can write them inline, like this: <LaTeX inline formula="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" />. Or, you can write them as a block:

<LaTeX formula="\int_a^b f(x) dx" />

## Tables

You can add simple tables using [GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables):

| Model | Accuracy | F1 score | Training time (hours) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| BERT-base | 0.89 | 0.87 | 4.5 |
| RoBERTa-large | 0.92 | 0.91 | 7.2 |
| DistilBERT | 0.86 | 0.84 | 2.1 |
| XLNet | 0.90 | 0.89 | 6.8 |

## Video

Here's an example of embedding a video directly into your project page. This section can be used to showcase demos, recorded talks, or supplementary materials.  

<Video
  src="Jellyfish-110877.mp4#t=0.001"
  name="Jellyfish"
  description="Video courtesy of Pixabay"
/>
