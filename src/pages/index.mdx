  This is a live demo of a research project template built with **Astro**.  
  It provides a clean, customizable framework for academic papers, projects, or presentations.  

  Content is written in **MDX**, letting you combine markdown formatting — such as **bold**, *italics*, and ~strikethrough~ — with Astro components for a flexible authoring experience.

## Headings

Use headings to structure your content into clear, readable sections.

### Heading 3

This is an example of a level-three heading.

#### Heading 4

And here is a level-four heading.

## LaTeX

Mathematical notation is supported via [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), rendered at build time for fast loading.  

Inline example: <LaTeX inline formula="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" />  

Block example:

<LaTeX formula="\int_a^b f(x)\, dx" />

## Tables

You can create tables using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables):

| Model         | Accuracy | F1 score | Training time (hours) |
| :------------ | :------: | :------: | :-------------------: |
| BERT-base     |   0.89   |   0.87   |          4.5          |
| RoBERTa-large |   0.92   |   0.91   |          7.2          |
| DistilBERT    |   0.86   |   0.84   |          2.1          |
| XLNet         |   0.90   |   0.89   |          6.8          |

## Video
