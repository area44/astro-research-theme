  This is a live demo of a research project template built with **Astro**.  
  It provides a clean, customizable framework for academic papers, projects, or presentations.  

  Content is written in **MDX**, letting you combine markdown formatting — such as **bold**, *italics*, and ~strikethrough~ — with Astro components for a flexible authoring experience.

## Markdown

Use headings to structure your content into clear, readable sections.

### Heading 3

This is an example of a level-three heading.

#### Heading 4

And here is a level-four heading.

## Tables

You can create tables using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables):

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |

## LaTeX

Mathematical notation is supported via [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), rendered at build time for fast loading.  

Inline example: <LaTeX inline formula="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" />  

Block example:

<LaTeX formula="\int_a^b f(x)\, dx" />

## Video

You can embed videos to showcase demos, recorded talks, or supplementary materials.  

<Video
  src="Jellyfish-110877.mp4#t=0.001"
  name="Jellyfish"
  description="Video courtesy of Pixabay"
/>
